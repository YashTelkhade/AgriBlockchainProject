# AgriBlockchainProject

Blockchain powered food supply chain to allow shoppers at a supermarket track the origins and freshness of the items they are purchasing.

All stakeholders in the supply chain interact with a web application to record different stages in the life cycle of a product.

Eventually products end up on the website of a supermarket where consumers can track the history of the items which they are purchasing.
